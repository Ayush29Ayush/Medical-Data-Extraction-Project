#! NOTE
PILLOW and its example
"
The Pillow library in Python is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and is used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It adds some user-friendly features like file format support and provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities. Pillow is often the preferred option for high-level image processing tasks that donâ€™t require more advanced image processing expertise, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers alike due to its simplicity and wide usage within the Python community.

```
from PIL import Image

# Open an image file
with Image.open('input_image.jpg') as img:
    # Resize the image
    resized_img = img.resize((300, 200))
    
    # Save the resized image with a new filename
    resized_img.save('resized_image.jpg')
```

#! INSTALLING LIBRARIES & DEPENDENCIES
8. We create 2 directories - frontend and backend to avoid conflicts
9. Create a requirements.txt file in backend directory and install all the dependencies in a virtual environment
10. pip install -r requirements.txt
11. Add a .gitignore file
12. Download pdf2image dependencies from "https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/"
13. Download the poppler, extract it, place it in the C drive and add its bin directory to env variable
14. Now download pre-build binary package for tesseract dependencies from "https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#installing-tesseract"

#! NOTEBOOKS
15. We create notebooks to test out small chunk of codes.
16. Our first notebook is prescription_parser to parse the prescription and get the details of the patient. We use the pdf2image library to convert the pdf to image, then tesseract to extract the text.
17. For image representaion, anything in black i.e the text written contains a value close to 0, and anything in white i.e the background contains a value close to 255. This is the concept followed in opencv.
18. For now, the issue we observe is that as the image contains a shadow from the mobile phone, any text written in that image is not recognized by tesseract.
19. To fix this issue, we will apply a threshold logic that if a pixel is close to 0, we will set it to 0 and if it is greater than 80, we will set it to 255. By doing this, we can get rid of the shadow and get the details of the text. This concept is called simple thresholding.
20. But there is a issue that if all the pixels of text inside the shadow is less than 80, then the entire shadow area is turned black and the text details are lost.
21. To fix this issue, rather than giving a global threshold of 80, we can have segment wise thresholding. This is called adaptive thresholding.
22. Try these concepts in a new ipynb file called cv_concepts.ipynb
23. Refer => "https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html"
24. Now add the adaptive thresholding logic inn prescription_parser.ipynb to get rid of the shadow and derive cleaned image.

25. To extract meaningful data from the extracted text. we will use regex i.e regular expressions.
#! REGEX
"
0. \ => the backslash (\) serves as an escape character. Its primary purpose is to indicate that the next character should be interpreted literally, rather than as a special character.
1. \d+ => Matches one or more digits
2. \s+ => Matches one or more whitespace characters
3. \w+ => Matches one or more alphanumeric characters
4. \W+ => Matches one or more non-alphanumeric characters
5. \S+ => Matches one or more non-whitespace characters
6. \D+ => Matches one or more non-digit characters
7. \b => Matches a word boundary
8. \B => Matches a non-word boundary
9. ^ => Matches the beginning of a string
10. $ => Matches the end of a string
11. . => Matches any character
12. * => Matches zero or more characters
13. + => Matches one or more characters
14. ? => Matches zero or one character
15. {10} => Matches exactly ten characters
16. {3,} => Matches three or more characters    
17. {3,5} => Matches three to five characters
18. [a-z] => Matches any lowercase letter
19. [A-Z] => Matches any uppercase letter
20. [a-zA-Z] => Matches any letter
21. [a-zA-Z0-9] => Matches any alphanumeric character
22. [^a-zA-Z0-9] => Matches any non-alphanumeric character
23. [^a-zA-Z0-9\s] => Matches any non-alphanumeric or whitespace character
24. [a-zA-Z0-9\s] => Matches any alphanumeric or whitespace character
25. \d{10} => Matches a 10-digit number
26. \d+\$ => Matches a number followed by a dollar sign
27. \d+ dollors|\d+\$ => Matches a number followed by either 'dollors' or '$'
