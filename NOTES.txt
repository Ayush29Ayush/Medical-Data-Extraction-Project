#! INSTALLING LIBRARIES & DEPENDENCIES
8. We create 2 directories - frontend and backend to avoid conflicts
9. Create a requirements.txt file in backend directory and install all the dependencies in a virtual environment
10. pip install -r requirements.txt
11. Add a .gitignore file
12. Download pdf2image dependencies from "https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/"
13. Download the poppler, extract it, place it in the C drive and add its bin directory to env variable
14. Now download pre-build binary package for tesseract dependencies from "https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#installing-tesseract"
